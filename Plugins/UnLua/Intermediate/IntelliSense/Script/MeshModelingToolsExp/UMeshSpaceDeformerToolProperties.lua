---@class UMeshSpaceDeformerToolProperties : UInteractiveToolPropertySet
---@field public SelectedOperationType ENonlinearOperationType
---@field public UpperBoundsInterval number @The upper bound to the region of space which the operation will affect. Measured along the gizmo Z axis from the gizmo center.
---@field public LowerBoundsInterval number @The lower bound to the region of space which the operation will affect. Measured along the gizmo Z axis from the gizmo center.
---@field public BendDegrees number @A line along the Z axis of the gizmo from lower bound to upper bound will be bent into a perfect arc of this many degrees in the direction of the Y axis without changing length.
---@field public TwistDegrees number @Degrees of twist to from the lower bound to the upper bound along the gizmo Z axis.
---@field public FlareProfileType EFlareProfileType @Determines the profile used as a displacement
---@field public FlarePercentY number @Determines how much to flare perpendicular to the Z axis. When set to 100%, points are moved double the distance away from the gizmo Z axis at the most extreme flare point. 0% does not flare at all, whereas -100% pinches all the way to the gizmo Z axis at the most extreme flare point.
---@field public bLockXAndYFlaring boolean @If true, flaring is applied along the gizmo X and Y axis the same amount.
---@field public FlarePercentX number @Determines how much to flare perpendicular to the Z axis in the X direction if the flaring is not locked to be the same in the X and Y directions.
---@field public bLockBottom boolean @If true, the "bottom" of the mesh relative to the gizmo Z axis will stay in place while the rest bends or twists. If false, the bend or twist will happen around the gizmo location.
---@field public bShowOriginalMesh boolean
---@field public bDrawVisualization boolean
---@field public bAlignToNormalOnCtrlClick boolean @When true, Ctrl+click not only moves the gizmo to the clicked location, but also aligns the Z axis with the normal at that point.
