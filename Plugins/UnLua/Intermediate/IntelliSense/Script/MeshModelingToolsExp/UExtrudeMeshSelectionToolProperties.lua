---@class UExtrudeMeshSelectionToolProperties : UInteractiveToolPropertySet
---@field public InputMode EExtrudeMeshSelectionInteractionMode @Control how the Extruded Area should be Transformed
---@field public ExtrudeDistance number @The Extrusion Distance used in Fixed Input Mode
---@field public RegionMode EExtrudeMeshSelectionRegionModifierMode @Control how the Extruded Area should be deformed as part of the Extrusion
---@field public NumSubdivisions integer @Specify the number of subdivisions along the sides of the Extrusion
---@field public CreaseAngle number @Specify the Crease Angle used to split the sides of the Extrusion into separate Groups
---@field public RaycastMaxDistance number @Control the maximum distance each vertex may be moved in Raycast To Plane Mode
---@field public bShellsToSolids boolean @If the Extruded Area has a fully open border, this option determines if Extrusion will create a Solid mesh or leave the base "open"
---@field public bInferGroupsFromNbrs boolean @Control whether a single Group should be generated along the sides of the Extrusion, or multiple Groups based on the adjacent Groups around the Extruded Area border
---@field public bGroupPerSubdivision boolean @Control whether a new Group is generated for each Subdivision
---@field public bReplaceSelectionGroups boolean @Control whether groups in the Extruded Area are mapped to new Groups, or replaced with a single new Group
---@field public UVScale number @The automatically-generated UVs on the sides of the Extrusion are scaled by this value
---@field public bUVIslandPerGroup boolean @Control whether a separate UV island should be generated for each output Group on the sides of the Extrusion, or a single UV island wrapping around the entire "tube"
---@field public bInferMaterialID boolean @Control whether SetMaterialID is assigned to all triangles along the sides of the Extrusion, or if MaterialIDs should be inferred from the Extruded Area
---@field public SetMaterialID integer @Constant Material ID used when MaterialIDs are not being inferred, or no adjacent MaterialID exists
---@field public bShowInputMaterials boolean @Control whether the original Mesh Materials should be shown, or a visualization of the extruded Groups
