---Resets the grid position and orientation based on the actor in Grid Source Actor. This allows
---grid positions/orientations to be saved by pasting them into the transform of some actor that
---is later used, or by relying on the fact that the tool initializes transforms of newly created
---meshes based on the grid used.

---Engages a mode where specific corners can be selected to push/pull only
---       those corners. Press Apply to commit the result afterward. Can also be toggled

---Accepts the output of the current tool and restarts it in "create new asset" mode.
---Used to avoid creating one huge mesh when working on different parts of a level.
---Note that undoing object creation will not remove any created assets on disc (i.e.
---undoing the creation of a static mesh will remove the actor from the world but not
---remove the static mesh asset from disc).
