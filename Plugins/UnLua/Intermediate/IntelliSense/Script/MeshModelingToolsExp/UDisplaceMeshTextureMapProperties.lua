---PropertySet for properties affecting the Image Map displacement type.
---@class UDisplaceMeshTextureMapProperties : UInteractiveToolPropertySet
---@field public DisplacementMap UTexture2D @Displacement map. Only the first channel is used.
---@field public Channel EDisplaceMeshToolChannelType @Channel in the displacement map to use.
---@field public DisplacementMapBaseValue number @The value in the texture map that corresponds to no displacement. For instance, if set to 0, then all        displacement will be positive. If set to 0.5, displacement below 0.5 will be negative, and above will be        positive. Default is for 128/255 to be no displacement.
---@field public UVScale FVector2D @When sampling from the texture map, how to scale the mesh UV's in the x and y directions. For a mesh with       UV's in the range 0 to 1, setting a scale above 1 will result in tiling the texture map, and scaling below       1 will result in using only part of the texture map.
---@field public UVOffset FVector2D @When sampling from the texture map, how to offset the mesh UV's. This will result in offsetting the       tiling of the texture map across the mesh.
---@field public bApplyAdjustmentCurve boolean @When true, applies a function to remap the values in the displacement map, which can be used        for contrast adjustment. The texture map values are converted to the range [0,1] before applying        the remapping.
---@field public AdjustmentCurve UCurveFloat @This curve is queried in the range [0,1] to adjust contrast of the displacement map.
---@field public bRecalcNormals boolean @Recalculate normals from displaced mesh. Disable this if you are applying Displacements that are paired with an existing Normal Map in your Material.
