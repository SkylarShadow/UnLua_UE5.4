---@field public bTryFixHoles boolean @Try to fill holes created by the merge, e.g. due to numerical errors
---@field public bTryCollapseEdges boolean @Try to collapse extra edges created by the merge
---@field public WindingThreshold number @Threshold to determine whether a triangle in one mesh is inside or outside of the other
---@field public bShowNewBoundaryEdges boolean @Show boundary edges created by the merge (often due to numerical error)
