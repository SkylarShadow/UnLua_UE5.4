---@field protected CachedMaps TMap<EBakeMapType, UTexture2D> @Internal cache of bake texture results. The tool can inject additional bake types that were not requested by the user. This can occur in cases where a particular bake type might need another bake type to preview such as BentNormal requiring AmbientOcclusion to preview. To avoid writing out assets that the user did not request, we introduce CachedMaps as a temporary texture cache for the tool preview. The Result array is then updated from CachedMaps to only hold user requested textures that are written out on Shutdown.
