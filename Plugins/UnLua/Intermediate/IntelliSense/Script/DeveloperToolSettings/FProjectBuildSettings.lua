---@class FProjectBuildSettings
---@field public Name string @The name for this custom build. It will be shown in menus for selection.
---@field public HelpText string @Any help that you would like to include in the ToolTip of the menu option (or shown in interactive mode Turnkey)
---@field public SpecificPlatforms TArray<string> @If this build step is specific to one or more platforms, add them here by name (note: use Windows, not Win64)
---@field public BuildCookRunParams string @The commandline for BuildCookRun UAT command. Some substitutions are allowed:   {Project} - Replaced with the path to the project's .uproject file   {Platform} - Replaced with the platform name this is run for   {inivalue:Config:Section:Key} - Replaced with the value for Key in Config's Section. Ex: -archivedirectory={inivalue:Engine:CustomSettings:OverrideArchiveDir}   {iniif:Token:Config:Section:Key} - Replaced with Token if the vlaue for Key in Config's Section evaluates to True. Ex: {iniif:-iostore:/Script/UnrealEd.ProjectPackagingSettings:bUseIoStore} Because ProjectPackagingSettings is a common section to read, if Config:Section: are not specified for 'iniif' or 'inivalue', it will use the ProjectPackagingSettings settings:   {iniif:-iostore:bUseIoStore} Additionally, the ini settings can have an optional search and replace modifier, to easily modify the string. The Replace can be blank:   {inivalue:BuildConfiguration|PPBC_=} - This will get the BuildConfiguration from the settings, and then remove the PPBC_ enum prefix from the string, to just get say Development
