---ULoudnessAnalyzer
---ULoudnessAnalyzer calculates the temporal evolution of perceptual loudness for a given
---audio bus in real-time. Loudness is available for individual channels or the overall audio bus. Normalized
---loudness values convert the range to 0.0 to 1.0 where 0.0 is the noise floor and 1.0 is the
---maximum loudness of the particular sound.
