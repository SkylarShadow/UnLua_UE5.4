---UConstantQSettings
---Settings for a UConstantQ analyzer.
---@class UConstantQSettings : UAudioSynesthesiaSettings
---@field public StartingFrequencyHz number @Starting frequency for first bin of CQT
---@field public NumBands integer @Total number of resulting constant Q bands.
---@field public NumBandsPerOctave number @Number of bands within an octave.
