---Emitter properties base class
---Each EmitterRenderer derives from this with its own class, and returns it in GetProperties; a copy
---of those specific properties is stored on UNiagaraEmitter (on the System) for serialization
---and handed back to the System renderer on load.
---@class UNiagaraRendererProperties : UNiagaraMergeable
---@field public Platforms FNiagaraPlatformSet @Platforms on which this renderer is enabled.
---@field public SortOrderHint integer @By default, emitters are drawn in the order that they are added to the system. This value will allow you to control the order in a more fine-grained manner.       Materials of the same type (i.e. Transparent) will draw in order from lowest to highest within the system. The default value is 0.
---@field public MotionVectorSetting ENiagaraRendererMotionVectorSetting @Hint about how to generate motion (velocity) vectors for this renderer.
---@field public RendererEnabledBinding FNiagaraVariableAttributeBinding @Binding to control if the renderer is enabled or disabled. When disabled the renderer does not generate or render any particle data. When disabled via a static bool the renderer will be removed in cooked content.
---@field public bIsEnabled boolean
---@field public bAllowInCullProxies boolean
---@field public OuterEmitterVersion FGuid
