---@field private Id FGuid @The id of this emitter handle.
---@field private IdName string @HACK!  Data sets used to use the emitter name, but this isn't guaranteed to be unique.  This is a temporary hack to allow the data sets to continue work with using names, but that code needs to be refactored to use the id defined here.
