---Data interface used to access a memory buffer.
---The user is responsible for how data is read / wrote.
---The DI will ensure no out of bounds access but not that the elements are of the correct type (i.e. float or int)
---Elements are considered to be 4 bytes in size.
---@class UNiagaraDataInterfaceMemoryBuffer : UNiagaraDataInterface
---@field public DefaultNumElements integer @Default space we will allocate for the memory buffer.
---@field public GpuSyncMode ENiagaraGpuSyncMode @How should we synhronize the data between CPU and GPU memory.
