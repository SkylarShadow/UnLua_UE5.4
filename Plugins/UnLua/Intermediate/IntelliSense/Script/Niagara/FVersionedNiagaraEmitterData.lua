---Struct containing all of the data that can be different between different emitter versions.
---@class FVersionedNiagaraEmitterData
---@field public Version FNiagaraAssetVersion
---@field public VersionChangeDescription string @What changed in this version compared to the last? Displayed to the user when upgrading to a new script version.
---@field public UpdateScriptExecution ENiagaraPythonUpdateScriptReference @Reference to a python script that is executed when the user updates from a previous version to this version.
---@field public PythonUpdateScript string @Python script to run when updating to this script version.
---@field public ScriptAsset FFilePath @Asset reference to a python script to run when updating to this script version.
---@field public bDeprecated boolean @If this emitter is no longer meant to be used, this option should be set.
---@field public DeprecationMessage string @Message to display when the script is deprecated.
---@field public bLocalSpace boolean @Toggles whether or not the particles within this emitter are relative to the emitter origin or in global space.
---@field public bDeterminism boolean @Toggles whether to globally make the random number generator be deterministic or non-deterministic. Any random calculation that is set to the emitter defaults will inherit this value. It is still possible to tweak individual random to be deterministic or not. In this case deterministic means that it will return the same results for the same configuration of the emitter as long as delta time is not variable. Any changes to the emitter's individual scripts will adjust the results.
---@field public RandomSeed integer @An emitter-based seed for the deterministic random number generator.
---@field public bInterpolatedSpawning boolean @When enabled, this will spawn using interpolated parameter values and perform a partial update at spawn time. This adds significant additional cost for spawning but will produce much smoother spawning for high spawn rates, erratic frame rates and fast moving emitters.
---@field public bGpuAlwaysRunParticleUpdateScript boolean @GPU scripts were incorrectly running both particle spawn & update, CPU only runs spawn when interpolated spawning is disabled. This flag allows backwards compatability so content does not change post the fix.
---@field public SimTarget ENiagaraSimTarget
---@field public CalculateBoundsMode ENiagaraEmitterCalculateBoundMode @How should we calculate bounds for the emitter. Note: If this is greyed out it means fixed bounds are enabled in the System Properties and these bounds are therefore ignored.
---@field public FixedBounds FBox @The fixed bounding box value. CalculateBoundsMode is the condition whether the fixed bounds can be edited. Note: If this is greyed out it means fixed bounds are enabled in the System Properties and these bounds are therefore ignored.
---@field public bRequiresPersistentIDs boolean @Creates a stable Identifier (Particles.ID) which does not vary from frame to frame. This comes at a small memory and performance cost. This allows external objects to track the same particle over multiple frames. Particle arrays are tightly packed and a particle's actual index in the array may change from frame to frame. This optionally lets you use a lookup table to track a particle by index in the lookup table.
---@field public EventHandlerScriptProps TArray<FNiagaraEventScriptProperties>
---@field public Platforms FNiagaraPlatformSet
---@field public ScalabilityOverrides FNiagaraEmitterScalabilityOverrides
---@field public MaxGPUParticlesSpawnPerFrame integer @An override on the max number of GPU particles we expect to spawn in a single frame. A value of 0 means it'll use fx.MaxNiagaraGPUParticlesSpawnPerFrame.
---@field public AllocationMode EParticleAllocationMode @The emitter needs to allocate memory for the particles each tick. To prevent reallocations, the emitter should allocate as much memory as is needed for the max particle count. This setting controls if the allocation size should be automatically determined or manually entered.
---@field public PreAllocationCount integer @The emitter will allocate at least this many particles on it's first tick. This can aid performance by avoiding many allocations as an emitter ramps up to it's max size.
