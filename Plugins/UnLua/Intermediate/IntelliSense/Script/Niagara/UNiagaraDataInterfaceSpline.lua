---@field public SoftSourceActor TSoftObjectPtr<AActor> @The source actor from which to sample.  Note that this can only be set when used as a user variable on a component in the world.
---@field public SplineUserParameter FNiagaraUserParameterBinding @Reference to a user parameter if we're reading one. This should  be an Object user parameter that is either a USplineComponent or an AActor containing a USplineComponent.
