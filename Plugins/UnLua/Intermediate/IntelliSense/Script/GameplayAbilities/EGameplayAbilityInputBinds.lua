---This is an example input binding enum for GameplayAbilities. Your project may want to create its own.
---The MetaData default bind keys (LMB, RMB, Q, E, etc) are a convenience for designers setting up abilities sets
---or whatever other data you have that gives an ability with a default key binding. Actual key binding is up to DefaultInput.ini
---E.g., "Ability1" is the command string that is bound to AbilitySystemComponent::ActivateAbility(1). The Meta data only *suggests*
---that you are binding "Ability1" to LMB by default in your projects DefaultInput.ini.
