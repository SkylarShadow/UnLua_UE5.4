---Handle for Targeting Data. This servers two main purposes:
---        -Avoid us having to copy around the full targeting data structure in Blueprints
---        -Allows us to leverage polymorphism in the target data structure
---        -Allows us to implement NetSerialize and replicate by value between clients/server
---        -Avoid using UObjects could be used to give us polymorphism and by reference passing in blueprints.
---        -However we would still be screwed when it came to replication
---        -Replication by value
---        -Pass by reference in blueprints
---        -Polymophism in TargetData structure
