---Data about montages that is replicated to simulated clients
---@class FGameplayAbilityRepAnimMontage
---@field public Animation UAnimSequenceBase @Animation ref. When playing a dynamic montage this points to the AnimSequence the montage was created from
---@field public SlotName string @Optional slot name used by dynamic montages.
---@field public PlayRate number @Play Rate
---@field public Position number @Montage position

---@field public BlendOutTime number @Optional blend out used by dynamic montages.
---@field public NextSectionID integer @NextSectionID
---@field public PlayInstanceId integer @ID incremented every time a montage is played, used to trigger replication when the same montage is played multiple times. This ID wraps around when it reaches its max value.
---@field public bRepPosition boolean @flag indicating we should serialize the position or the current section id
---@field public IsStopped boolean @Bit set when montage has been stopped.
---@field public SkipPositionCorrection boolean @Stops montage position from replicating at all to save bandwidth
---@field public bSkipPlayRate boolean @Stops PlayRate from replicating to save bandwidth. PlayRate will be assumed to be 1.f.
