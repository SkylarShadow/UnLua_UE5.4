---FGameplayAbilityActorInfo
---Cached data associated with an Actor using an Ability.
---        -Initialized from an AActor* in InitFromActor
---        -Abilities use this to know what to actor upon. E.g., instead of being coupled to a specific actor class.
---        -These are generally passed around as pointers to support polymorphism.
---        -Projects can override UAbilitySystemGlobals::AllocAbilityActorInfo to override the default struct type that is created.
