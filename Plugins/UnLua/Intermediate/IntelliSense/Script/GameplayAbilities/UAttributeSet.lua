---Defines the set of all GameplayAttributes for your game
---Games should subclass this and add FGameplayAttributeData properties to represent attributes like health, damage, etc
---AttributeSets are added to the actors as subobjects, and then registered with the AbilitySystemComponent
---It often desired to have several sets per project that inherit from each other
---You could make a base health set, then have a player set that inherits from it and adds more attributes
---@class UAttributeSet : UObject
local UAttributeSet = {}
