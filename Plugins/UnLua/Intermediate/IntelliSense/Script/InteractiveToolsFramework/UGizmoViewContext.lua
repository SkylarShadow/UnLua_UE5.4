---A context object that is meant to hold the scene information for the hovered viewport
---on a game thread, to be used by a gizmo later for hit testing. The organization mirrors
---FSceneView so that functions could be written in a templated way to use either FSceneView
---or UGizmoViewContext, though UGizmoViewContext only keeps the needed data.
---@class UGizmoViewContext : UObject
local UGizmoViewContext = {}
