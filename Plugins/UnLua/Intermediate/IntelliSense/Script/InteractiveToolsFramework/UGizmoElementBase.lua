---Base class for 2d and 3d primitive objects intended to be used as part of 3D Gizmos.
---Contains common properties and utility functions.
---This class does nothing by itself, use subclasses like UGizmoElementCylinder
---@class UGizmoElementBase : UObject
---@field protected bEnabled boolean @Whether element is enabled. Render and LineTrace only occur when bEnabled is true.
---@field protected bEnabledForPerspectiveProjection boolean @Whether element is enabled for perspective projection
---@field protected bEnabledForOrthographicProjection boolean @Whether element is enabled for orthographic projection
---@field protected bEnabledForDefaultState boolean @Whether element is enabled when element state is default
---@field protected bEnabledForHoveringState boolean @Whether element is enabled when element state is hovering
---@field protected bEnabledForInteractingState boolean @Whether element is enabled when element state is interacting
---@field protected PartIdentifier integer @Part identifier
---@field protected MeshRenderAttributes FGizmoElementMeshRenderStateAttributes @Mesh render state attributes for this element
---@field protected ElementState EGizmoElementState @Element state - indicates whether object is visible or hittable
---@field protected ElementInteractionState EGizmoElementInteractionState @Current element interaction state - None, Hovering or Interacting
---@field protected ViewDependentType EGizmoElementViewDependentType @View-dependent type - None, Axis or Plane.
---@field protected ViewDependentAxis FVector @View-dependent axis or plane normal, based on the view-dependent type.
---@field protected ViewDependentAngleTol number @View-dependent angle tolerance based on :   For Axis, minimum radians between view dependent axis and view direction.   For Planar, minimum radians between view dependent axis and the plane where axis is its normal. When the angle between the view direction and the axis/plane is less than this tolerance, this object should be culled.
---@field protected ViewDependentAxialMaxCosAngleTol number @Axial view alignment minimum cos angle tolerance, computed based on ViewDependentAngleTol. When the cos of the angle between the view direction and the axis is less than this value, this object should not be culled.
---@field protected ViewDependentPlanarMinCosAngleTol number @Planar view alignment minimum cos angle tolerance, computed based on ViewDependentAngleTol. When the cos of the angle between the view direction and the axis is greater than this value, this object should not be culled.
---@field protected ViewAlignType EGizmoElementViewAlignType @View align type: None, PointEye, or PointWorld. PointEye rotates this axis to align with the view up axis. PointWorld rotates this axis to align with the world up axis. Axial rotates around this axis to align the normal as closely as possible to the view direction.
---@field protected ViewAlignAxis FVector @View align axis.
---@field protected ViewAlignNormal FVector @View align normal. PointEye and PointWorld both rotate the normal to align with the view direction. Axial rotates the normal to align as closely as possible with view direction.
---@field protected ViewAlignAxialAngleTol number @Axial view alignment angle tolerance in radians, based on angle between align normal and view direction. When angle between the view align normal and the view direction is greater than this angle, the align rotation will be computed.
---@field protected ViewAlignAxialMaxCosAngleTol number @Axial view alignment minimum cos angle tolerance, computed based on ViewAlignAxialAngleTol. When the cos of the angle between the view direction and the align normal is less than this value, the align rotation will be computed.
---@field protected PixelHitDistanceThreshold number @Pixel hit distance threshold, element will be scaled enough to add this threshold when line-tracing.
