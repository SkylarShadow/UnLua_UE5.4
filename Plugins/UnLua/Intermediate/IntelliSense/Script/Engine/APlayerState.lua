---A PlayerState is created for every player on a server (or in a standalone game).
---PlayerStates are replicated to all clients, and contain network game relevant information about the player, such as playername, score, etc.
---@class APlayerState : AInfo
---@field public Score number
---@field public PlayerId integer
---@field private CompressedPing integer @Replicated compressed ping for this player (holds ping in msec divided by 4)
---@field private bShouldUpdateReplicatedPing boolean @Whether or not this player's replicated CompressedPing value is updated automatically. Since player states are always relevant by default, in cases where there are many players replicating, replicating the ping value can cause additional unnecessary overhead on servers if the value isn't needed on clients.

---@field public bFromPreviousLevel boolean
---@field public StartTime integer
---@field public EngineMessageClass TSubclassOf<ULocalMessage> @This is used for sending game agnostic messages that can be localized
---@field public SavedNetworkAddress string @Used to match up InactivePlayerState with rejoining playercontroller.
---@field public UniqueId FUniqueNetIdRepl
---@field public OnPawnSet MulticastDelegate @Broadcast whenever this player's possessed pawn is set
---@field private PawnPrivate APawn @The pawn that is controlled by by this player state.
