---Sequence player node that can be used with constant folding
---@class FAnimNode_SequencePlayer : FAnimNode_SequencePlayerBase
---@field protected GroupName string @The group name that we synchronize with (NAME_None if it is not part of any group).
---@field protected GroupRole integer @The role this node can assume within the group (ignored if GroupName is not set)
---@field protected Method EAnimSyncMethod @How this node will synchronize with other animations.
---@field protected bIgnoreForRelevancyTest boolean @If true, "Relevant anim" nodes that look for the highest weighted animation in a state will ignore this node
---@field protected Sequence UAnimSequenceBase @The animation sequence asset to play
---@field protected PlayRateBasis number @The Basis in which the PlayRate is expressed in. This is used to rescale PlayRate inputs. For example a Basis of 100 means that the PlayRate input will be divided by 100.
---@field protected PlayRate number @The play rate multiplier. Can be negative, which will cause the animation to play in reverse.
---@field protected PlayRateScaleBiasClampConstants FInputScaleBiasClampConstants @Additional scaling, offsetting and clamping of PlayRate input. Performed after PlayRateBasis.
---@field protected StartPosition number @The start position between 0 and the length of the sequence to use when initializing. When looping, play will still jump back to the beginning when reaching the end.
---@field protected bLoopAnimation boolean @Should the animation loop back to the start when it reaches the end?
---@field protected bStartFromMatchingPose boolean @Use pose matching to choose the start position. Requires experimental PoseSearch plugin.
