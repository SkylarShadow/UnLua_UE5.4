---Actor containing all script accessible world properties.
---@class AWorldSettings : AInfo
---@field public VisibilityCellSize integer @World space size of precomputed visibility cells in x and y. Smaller sizes produce more effective occlusion culling at the cost of increased runtime memory usage and lighting build times.
---@field public VisibilityAggressiveness integer @Determines how aggressive precomputed visibility should be. More aggressive settings cull more objects but also cause more visibility errors like popping.
---@field public bPrecomputeVisibility boolean @Whether to place visibility cells inside Precomputed Visibility Volumes and along camera tracks in this level. Precomputing visibility reduces rendering thread time at the cost of some runtime memory and somewhat increased lighting build times.
---@field public bPlaceCellsOnlyAlongCameraTracks boolean @Whether to place visibility cells only along camera tracks or only above shadow casting surfaces.
---@field public bEnableWorldBoundsChecks boolean @If true, enables CheckStillInWorld checks
---@field protected bEnableNavigationSystem boolean
---@field protected bEnableAISystem boolean @if set to false AI system will not get created. Use it to disable all AI-related activity on a map
---@field public bEnableWorldComposition boolean @Enables tools for composing a tiled world. Level has to be saved and all sub-levels removed before enabling this option.
---@field public bUseClientSideLevelStreamingVolumes boolean @Enables client-side streaming volumes instead of server-side. Expected usage scenario: server has all streaming levels always loaded, clients independently stream levels in/out based on streaming volumes.
---@field public bEnableWorldOriginRebasing boolean @World origin will shift to a camera position when camera goes far away from current origin
---@field public bWorldGravitySet boolean @if set to true, when we call GetGravityZ we assume WorldGravityZ has already been initialized and skip the lookup of DefaultGravityZ and GlobalGravityZ
---@field public bGlobalGravitySet boolean @If set to true we will use GlobalGravityZ instead of project setting DefaultGravityZ
---@field public bMinimizeBSPSections boolean @Causes the BSP build to generate as few sections as possible. This is useful when you need to reduce draw calls but can reduce texture streaming efficiency and effective lightmap resolution. Note - changes require a rebuild to propagate.  Also, be sure to select all surfaces and make sure they all have the same flags to minimize section count.
---@field public bForceNoPrecomputedLighting boolean @Whether to force lightmaps and other precomputed lighting to not be created even when the engine thinks they are needed. This is useful for improving iteration in levels with fully dynamic lighting and shadowing. Note that any lighting and shadowing interactions that are usually precomputed will be lost if this is enabled.
---@field public bHighPriorityLoading boolean @when this flag is set, more time is allocated to background loading (replicated)
---@field public bHighPriorityLoadingLocal boolean @copy of bHighPriorityLoading that is not replicated, for clientside-only loading operations
---@field public bOverrideDefaultBroadphaseSettings boolean
---@field public bGenerateSingleClusterForLevel boolean @If set to true, all eligible actors in this level will be added to a single cluster representing the entire level (used for small sublevels)
---@field public bHideEnableStreamingWarning boolean @if set to true, this hide the streaming disabled warning available in the viewport
---@field public bIncludeGridSizeInNameForFoliageActors boolean @Whether Foliage actors of this world contain their grid size in their name. This should only be changed by UWorldPartitionFoliageBuilder or when creating new worlds so that older worlds are unaffected and is used by the UActorPartitionSubsystem to find existing foliage actors by name.
---@field public bIncludeGridSizeInNameForPartitionedActors boolean @Whether partitioned actors of this world contain their grid size in their name. This should only be changed when creating new worlds so that older worlds are unaffected and is used by the UActorPartitionSubsystem to find existing foliage actors by name.
---@field public bReuseAddressAndPort boolean @Whether to configure the listening socket to allow reuse of the address and port. If this is true, be sure no other servers can run on the same port, otherwise this can lead to undefined behavior since packets will go to two servers.
---@field public AISystemClass TSoftClassPtr<UAISystemBase>
---@field public LevelInstancePivotOffset FVector @Additional transform applied when applying LevelStreaming Transform to LevelInstance
---@field protected NavigationSystemConfig UNavigationSystemConfig @Holds parameters for NavigationSystem's creation. Set to Null will result     in NavigationSystem instance not being created for this world. Note that     if set NavigationSystemConfigOverride will be used instead.
---@field protected NavigationSystemConfigOverride UNavigationSystemConfig @Overrides NavigationSystemConfig.
---@field protected WorldPartition UWorldPartition
---@field public InstancedFoliageGridSize integer @Size of the grid for instanced foliage actors, only used for partitioned worlds
---@field public bShowInstancedFoliageGrid boolean
---@field public LandscapeSplineMeshesGridSize integer
---@field public NavigationDataChunkGridSize integer @Size of the grid for navigation data chunk actors
---@field public NavigationDataBuilderLoadingCellSize integer @Loading cell size used when building navigation data iteratively. The actual cell size used will be rounded using the NavigationDataChunkGridSize. It's recommended to use a value as high as the hardware memory allows to load.
---@field public DefaultPlacementGridSize integer @Default size of the grid for placed elements from the editor
---@field public BaseNavmeshDataLayers TArray<UDataLayerAsset> @A list of runtime data layers that should be included in the base navmesh. Editor data layers and actors outside data layers will be included.
---@field public WorldToMeters number @scale of 1uu to 1m in real world measurements, for HMD and other physically tracked devices (e.g. 1uu = 1cm would be 100.0)
---@field public KillZ number @any actor falling below this level gets destroyed
---@field public KillZDamageType TSubclassOf<UDamageType> @The type of damage inflicted when a actor falls below KillZ
---@field public WorldGravityZ number @current gravity actually being used

---@field public DefaultPhysicsVolumeClass TSubclassOf<ADefaultPhysicsVolume> @level specific default physics volume
---@field public PhysicsCollisionHandlerClass TSubclassOf<UPhysicsCollisionHandler> @optional level specific collision handler
---@field public DefaultGameMode TSubclassOf<AGameModeBase> @The default GameMode to use when starting this map in the game. If this value is NULL, the INI setting for default game type is used.

---@field public TimeDilation number @Normally 1 - scales real time passage. Warning - most use cases should use GetEffectiveTimeDilation() instead of reading from this directly
---@field public CinematicTimeDilation number @Additional time dilation used by Sequencer slomo track.  Transient because this is often temporarily modified by the editor when previewing slow motion effects, yet we don't want it saved or loaded from level packages.
