---Blueprints are special assets that provide an intuitive, node-based interface that can be used to create new types of Actors
---and script level events; giving designers and gameplay programmers the tools to quickly create and iterate gameplay from
---within Unreal Editor without ever needing to write a line of code.
---@class UBlueprint : UBlueprintCore
---@field public ParentClass TSubclassOf<UObject> @Pointer to the parent class that the generated class should derive from. This *can* be null under rare circumstances, one such case can be created by creating a blueprint (A) based on another blueprint (B), shutting down the editor, and deleting the parent blueprint. Exported as Alphabetical in GetAssetRegistryTags
---@field public BlueprintType integer @The type of this blueprint
---@field public bRecompileOnLoad boolean @Whether or not this blueprint should recompile itself on load
---@field public bHasBeenRegenerated boolean @When the class generated by this blueprint is loaded, it will be recompiled the first time.  After that initial recompile, subsequent loads will skip the regeneration step
---@field public bIsRegeneratingOnLoad boolean @State flag to indicate whether or not the Blueprint is currently being regenerated on load
---@field public bBeingCompiled boolean @The blueprint is currently compiled
---@field public bIsNewlyCreated boolean @Whether or not this blueprint is newly created, and hasn't been opened in an editor yet
---@field public bForceFullEditor boolean @Whether to force opening the full (non data-only) editor for this blueprint.
---@field public bQueuedForCompilation boolean
---@field public bRunConstructionScriptOnDrag boolean @whether or not you want to continuously rerun the construction script for an actor as you drag it in the editor, or only when the drag operation is complete
---@field public bRunConstructionScriptInSequencer boolean @whether or not you want to continuously rerun the construction script for an actor in sequencer
---@field public bGenerateConstClass boolean @Whether or not this blueprint's class is a const class or not.  Should set CLASS_Const in the KismetCompiler.
---@field public bGenerateAbstractClass boolean @Whether or not this blueprint's class is a abstract class or not.  Should set CLASS_Abstract in the KismetCompiler.
---@field public bDisplayCompilePIEWarning boolean @TRUE to show a warning when attempting to start in PIE and there is a compiler error on this Blueprint
---@field public bDeprecate boolean @Deprecates the Blueprint, marking the generated class with the CLASS_Deprecated flag
---@field public bDuplicatingReadOnly boolean @Flag indicating that a read only duplicate of this blueprint is being created, used to disable logic in ::PostDuplicate, This flag needs to be copied on duplication (because it's the duplicated object that we're disabling on PostDuplicate), but we don't *need* to serialize it for permanent objects. Without setting this flag a blueprint will be marked dirty when it is duplicated and if saved while in this dirty state you will not be able to open the blueprint. More specifically, UClass::Rename (called by DestroyGeneratedClass) sets a dirty flag on the package. Once saved the package will fail to open because some unnamed objects are present in the pacakge. This flag can be used to avoid the package being marked as dirty in the first place. Ideally PostDuplicateObject would not rename classes that are still in use by the original object.
---@field public ShouldCookPropertyGuidsValue EShouldCookBlueprintPropertyGuids @Whether to include the property GUIDs for the generated class in a cooked build.

---@field public BlueprintCategory string @The category of the Blueprint, used to organize this Blueprint class when displayed in palette windows
---@field public HideCategories TArray<string> @Additional HideCategories. These are added to HideCategories from parent.
---@field public BlueprintSystemVersion integer @The version of the blueprint system that was used to  create this blueprint

---@field public Timelines TArray<UTimelineTemplate> @Array of templates for timelines that should be created
---@field public ComponentClassOverrides TArray<FBPComponentClassOverride> @Array of blueprint overrides of component classes in parent classes
---@field public InheritableComponentHandler UInheritableComponentHandler @Stores data to override (in children classes) components (created by SCS) from parent classes
---@field public NewVariables TArray<FBPVariableDescription> @Array of new variables to be added to generated class
---@field public CategorySorting TArray<string> @Array of user sorted categories
---@field public ImportedNamespaces TSet<string> @Namespaces imported by this blueprint
---@field public ImplementedInterfaces TArray<FBPInterfaceDescription> @Array of info about the interfaces we implement in this blueprint
---@field public LastEditedDocuments TArray<FEditedDocumentInfo> @Set of documents that were being edited in this blueprint, so we can open them right away
---@field public Bookmarks TMap<FGuid, FEditedDocumentInfo> @Bookmark data
---@field public BookmarkNodes TArray<FBPEditorBookmarkNode> @Bookmark nodes (for display)
---@field public DeprecatedPinWatches TArray<UEdGraphPin_Deprecated>

---@field public ThumbnailInfo UThumbnailInfo @Information for thumbnail rendering
---@field public CrcLastCompiledCDO integer @CRC for CDO calculated right after the latest compilation used by Reinstancer to check if default values were changed
---@field public CrcLastCompiledSignature integer
---@field public bCachedDependenciesUpToDate boolean @Transient flag that indicates whether or not the internal dependency cache needs to be updated. This is not carried forward by duplication so that the post-duplicate compile path is forced to reinitialize the cache.
---@field public CachedDependencies TSet<TWeakObjectPtr<UBlueprint>> @Set of blueprints that we reference - i.e. blueprints that we have some kind of reference to (variable of that blueprints type or function call We need this to be serializable so that its references can be collected. This is intentionally marked 'duplicatetransient' so that it won't carry over to a duplicated Blueprint object. The post-duplicate compile path will instead regenerate this set to be relative to the duplicated object.
---@field public CachedDependents TSet<TWeakObjectPtr<UBlueprint>> @Transient cache of dependent blueprints - i.e. blueprints that call functions declared in this blueprint. Used to speed up compilation checks This is intentionally marked 'duplicatetransient' so that it won't carry over to a duplicated Blueprint object. However, the post-duplicate compile path will not regenerate this set, since it is populated by each dependent Blueprint's compile. In this case, a duplicated Blueprint equates to a new Blueprint, so it won't initially have any dependents to include here.
---@field public CachedUDSDependencies TSet<TWeakObjectPtr<UStruct>> @User Defined Structures the blueprint depends on This is intentionally marked 'duplicatetransient' so that it won't carry over to a duplicated Blueprint object. The post-duplicate compile path will instead regenerate this set to be relative to the duplicated object.
---@field public OriginalClass TSubclassOf<UObject> @If this BP is just a duplicate created for a specific compilation, the reference to original GeneratedClass is needed
