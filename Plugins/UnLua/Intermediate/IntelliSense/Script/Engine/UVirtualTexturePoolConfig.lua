---Configuration for virtual texture physical pool sizes.
---@class UVirtualTexturePoolConfig : UDeveloperSettings
---@field public DefaultSizeInMegabyte integer @Upper size limit in megabytes for any pools not explicitly matched by a config entry in the Pools array.
---@field public bPoolAutoGrowInEditor boolean @Enable physical pools growing on oversubscription. Each physical pool will grow to the maximum size so far requested. This setting applies to the editor only. To have similar behavior in a cooked build use r.VT.PoolAutoGrow.
---@field public Pools TArray<FVirtualTextureSpacePoolConfig> @Serialized array of configs. A virtual texture physical pool iterates these from last to first and uses the first matching config that it finds.
---@field public TransientPools TArray<FVirtualTextureSpacePoolConfig> @Transient array of runtime detected configs used by the PoolAutoGrow system. A virtual texture physical pool searches these to find a match before searching the configs in Pools. These tracked configs can be copied to the serialized Pools as a good estimation of the fixed pool sizes that a cooked project needs.
