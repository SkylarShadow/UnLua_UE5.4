---If one wishes to use the NetObjectCountLimiter prioritizer for PlayerStates
---this class makes it possible to have specific settings for PlayerStates in
---case other classes also wish to use said prioritizer.
---Only available if running with Iris replication.
---The PlayerState will look for a prioritizer aptly named PlayerState and
---set that prioritizer for it. It could be any kind of prioritizer but
---if the NetObjectCountLimiter is used this config will come in handy.
---@class UPlayerStateCountLimiterConfig : UNetObjectCountLimiterConfig
