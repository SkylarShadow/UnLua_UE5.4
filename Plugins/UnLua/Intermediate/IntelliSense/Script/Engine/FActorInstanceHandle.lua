---Handle to a unique object. This may specify a full weigh actor or it may only specify the actor instance that represents the same object.
---    Can only be used on the game thread
---    -       all constructors
---    -       all getters (GetXYZ, FetchActor, IsActorValid, DoesRepresent) *
---    -       comparison operators against live AActor pointer
---    Can be used on any thread
---    -       MakeActorHandleToResolve to create a handle that will be lazily resolved on the game thread
---            since it only stores a weak object ptr without any access to the live object
---    -       handle validity and comparison operators against another handle (i.e. IsValid(), operator==|!=(const FActorInstanceHandle& Other))
---@class FActorInstanceHandle
---@field private ReferenceObject TWeakObjectPtr<UObject> @Weak UObject pointer used for two purposes:  - a resolved handle uses it to store the AActor  - a handle to be resolved uses it to store the UPrimitiveComponent provided by MakeActorHandleToResolve
local FActorInstanceHandle = {}
