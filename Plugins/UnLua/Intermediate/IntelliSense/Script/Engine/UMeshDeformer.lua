---Base class for mesh deformer assets.
---Mesh deformers can be added to mesh components to implement flexible deformation systems.
---A UMeshDeformer needs to implement creation of a UMeshDeformerInstance which will apply deformer actions and store deformer state.
---@class UMeshDeformer : UObject
local UMeshDeformer = {}
