---Properties for equirect layers
---@class FEquirectProps
---@field public LeftUVRect FBox2D @Left source texture UVRect, specifying portion of input texture corresponding to left eye.
---@field public RightUVRect FBox2D @Right source texture UVRect, specifying portion of input texture corresponding to right eye.
---@field public LeftScale FVector2D @Left eye's texture coordinate scale after mapping to 2D.
---@field public RightScale FVector2D @Right eye's texture coordinate scale after mapping to 2D.
---@field public LeftBias FVector2D @Left eye's texture coordinate bias after mapping to 2D.
---@field public RightBias FVector2D @Right eye's texture coordinate bias after mapping to 2D.
---@field public Radius number @Sphere radius. As of UE 5.3, equirect layers are supported only by the Oculus OpenXR runtime and only with a radius of 0 (infinite sphere).
