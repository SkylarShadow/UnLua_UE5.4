---@class FInterpolationParameter
---@field public InterpolationTime number @Smoothing Time used to move smoothly across the blendpsace from the current parameters to the target parameters. The different Smoothing Types will treat this in different ways, but in general a value of zero will disable all smoothing, and larger values will smooth more.
---@field public DampingRatio number @Damping ratio - only used when the type is set to SpringDamper. A value of 1 will move quickly and smoothly to the target, without overshooting. Values as low as 0 can be used to encourage some overshoot, and values around 0.7 can make pose transitions look more natural.
---@field public MaxSpeed number @Maximum speed, in real units. For example, if this axis is degrees then you could use a value of 90 to limit the turn rate to 90 degrees per second. Only used when greater than zero and the type is set to SpringDamper or Exponential.
---@field public InterpolationType integer @Type of smoothing used for filtering the input value to decide how to get to target.
