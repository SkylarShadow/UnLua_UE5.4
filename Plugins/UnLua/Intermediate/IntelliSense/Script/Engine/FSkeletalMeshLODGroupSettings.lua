---@class FSkeletalMeshLODGroupSettings
---@field public ScreenSize FPerPlatformFloat @The screen sizes to use for the respective LOD level
---@field public LODHysteresis number @Used to avoid 'flickering' when on LOD boundary. Only taken into account when moving from complex->simple.
---@field public BoneFilterActionOption EBoneFilterActionOption @Bones which should be removed from the skeleton for the LOD level
---@field public BoneList TArray<FBoneFilter> @Bones which should be removed from the skeleton for the LOD level
---@field public BonesToPrioritize TArray<string> @Bones which should be prioritized for the quality, this will be weighted toward keeping source data. Use WeightOfPrioritization to control the value.
---@field public SectionsToPrioritize TArray<integer> @Sections which should be prioritized for the quality, this will be weighted toward keeping source data. Use WeightOfPrioritization to control the value.
---@field public WeightOfPrioritization number @How much to consideration to give BonesToPrioritize and SectionsToPrioritize.  The weight is an additional vertex simplification penalty where 0 means nothing.
---@field public BakePose UAnimSequence @Pose which should be used to reskin vertex influences for which the bones will be removed in this LOD level, uses ref-pose by default
---@field public ReductionSettings FSkeletalMeshOptimizationSettings @The optimization settings to use for the respective LOD level
---@field public bAllowMeshDeformer boolean @Whether a Mesh Deformer applied to the mesh asset or Skinned Mesh Component should be used on this LOD or not
