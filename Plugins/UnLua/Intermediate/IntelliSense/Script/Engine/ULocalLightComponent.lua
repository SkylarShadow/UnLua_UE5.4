---A light component which emits light from a single point equally in all directions.
---@class ULocalLightComponent : ULightComponent
---@field public IntensityUnits ELightUnits @Units used for the intensity. The peak luminous intensity is measured in candelas, while the luminous power is measured in lumens.
---@field public InverseExposureBlend number @Blend Factor used to blend between Intensity and Intensity/Exposure. This is useful for gameplay lights that should have constant brighness on screen independent of current exposure. This feature can cause issues with exposure particularly when used on the primary light on a scene, as such it's usage should be limited.
---@field public AttenuationRadius number @Bounds the light's visible influence. This clamping of the light's influence is not physically correct but very important for performance, larger lights cost more.
---@field public LightmassSettings FLightmassPointLightSettings @The Lightmass settings for this object.
