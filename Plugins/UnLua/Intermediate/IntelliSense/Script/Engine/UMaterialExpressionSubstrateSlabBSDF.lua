---@class UMaterialExpressionSubstrateSlabBSDF : UMaterialExpressionSubstrateBSDF
---@field public DiffuseAlbedo FExpressionInput @Defines the diffused albedo, the percentage of light reflected as diffuse from the surface. (type = float3, unit = unitless, defaults to 0.18)
---@field public F0 FExpressionInput @Defines the color and brightness of the specular highlight where the surface is facing the camera. Each specular contribution will fade to black as F0 drops below 0.02. (type = float3, unit = unitless, defaults to plastic 0.04)
---@field public F90 FExpressionInput @Defines the color of the specular highlight where the surface normal is 90 degrees from the view direction. Only the hue and saturation are preserved, the brightness is fixed at 1.0. Fades to black as F0 drops below 0.02. (type = float3, unit = unitless, defaults to 1.0f)
---@field public Roughness FExpressionInput @Controls how rough the Material is. Roughness of 0 (smooth) is a mirror reflection and 1 (rough) is completely matte or diffuse. When using anisotropy, it is the roughness used along the Tangent axis. (type = float, unit = unitless, defaults to 0.5)
---@field public Anisotropy FExpressionInput @Controls the anisotropy factor of the roughness. Positive value elongates the specular lobe along the Tangent vector, Negative value elongates the specular lobe along the perpendicular of the Tangent. (type = float, unit = unitless).
---@field public Normal FExpressionInput @Take the surface normal as input. The normal is considered tangent or world space according to the space properties on the main material node. (type = float3, unit = unitless, defaults to vertex normal)
---@field public Tangent FExpressionInput @Take a surface tangent as input. The tangent is considered tangent or world space according to the space properties on the main material node. (type = float3, unit = unitless, defaults to vertex tangent)
---@field public SSSMFP FExpressionInput @Chromatic mean free path . Only used when there is not any sub-surface profile provided. (type = float3, unit = centimeters, default = 0)
---@field public SSSMFPScale FExpressionInput @Scale the mean free path radius of the SSS profile according to a value between 0 and 1. Always used, when a subsurface profile is provided or not. (type = float, unitless, defaults to 1)
---@field public SSSPhaseAnisotropy FExpressionInput @Phase function anisotropy. Positive value elongates the phase function along the lignt direction, causing forward scattering. Negative value elongates the phase function backward to the light direction, causing backward scattering.  (type = float, unitless, defaults to 1, valid value -1..1)
---@field public EmissiveColor FExpressionInput @Emissive color on top of the surface (type = float3, unit = luminance, default = 0)
---@field public SecondRoughness FExpressionInput @Controls the roughness of a secondary specular lobe. Roughness of 0 (smooth) is a mirror reflection and 1 (rough) is completely matte or diffuse. Does not influence diffuse roughness. (type = float, unit = unitless, defaults to 0.5)
---@field public SecondRoughnessWeight FExpressionInput @The weight of the second specular lobe using SecondRoughness. The first specular using Roughness will have a weight of (1 - SecondRoughnessWeight). (type = float, unitless, default = 0)
---@field public FuzzRoughness FExpressionInput @Controls how rough the Fuzz layer is. Roughness of 0 is smooth and 1 is rough. If FuzzRoughness Is not connected, the Roughness input will be used instead. (type = float, unit = unitless, defaults to 0.5)
---@field public FuzzAmount FExpressionInput @The amount of fuzz on top of the surface used to simulate cloth-like appearance.
---@field public FuzzColor FExpressionInput @The base color of the fuzz.
---@field public GlintValue FExpressionInput @This represent the logarithm of the micro facet density. Only used when `r.Substrate.Glints=1`. Defaults to 0.
---@field public GlintUV FExpressionInput @The parameterization of the surface required to position glints on a surface. Only used when `r.Substrate.Glints=1`. Defaults to (0,0).
---@field public SubsurfaceProfile USubsurfaceProfile @SubsurfaceProfile, for Screen Space Subsurface Scattering. The profile needs to be set up on both the Substrate diffuse node, and the material node at the moment.
---@field public SpecularProfile USpecularProfile @SpecularProfile, for modulating specular appearance and simulating more complex visuals such as iridescence.
---@field public bUseSSSDiffusion boolean @Whether to use light diffusion (i.e., SSS diffusion) or wrap-approximation for material with scattering behavior. This option trades quality over performance and will result into visual differences.
