---@class FMinimalViewInfo
---@field public Location FVector @Location
---@field public Rotation FRotator @Rotation
---@field public FOV number @The horizontal field of view (in degrees) in perspective mode (ignored in orthographic mode).
---@field public DesiredFOV number @The originally desired horizontal field of view before any adjustments to account for different aspect ratios
---@field public OrthoWidth number @The desired width (in world units) of the orthographic view (ignored in Perspective mode)
---@field public bAutoCalculateOrthoPlanes boolean @Option for the Ortho camera to automatically calculated the near/far plane
---@field public AutoPlaneShift number @Manually adjusts the planes of this camera, maintaining the distance between them. Positive moves out to the farplane, negative towards the near plane
---@field public bUpdateOrthoPlanes boolean @Adjusts the near/far planes and the view origin of the current camera automatically to avoid clipping and light artefacting
---@field public bUseCameraHeightAsViewTarget boolean @If UpdateOrthoPlanes is enabled, this setting will use the cameras current height to compensate the distance to the general view (as a pseudo distance to view target when one isn't present)
---@field public OrthoNearClipPlane number @The near plane distance of the orthographic view (in world units)
---@field public OrthoFarClipPlane number @The far plane distance of the orthographic view (in world units)
---@field public PerspectiveNearClipPlane number @The near plane distance of the perspective view (in world units). Set to a negative value to use the default global value of GNearClippingPlane
---@field public AspectRatio number @Aspect Ratio (Width/Height)
---@field public bConstrainAspectRatio boolean @If bConstrainAspectRatio is true, black bars will be added if the destination view has a different aspect ratio than this camera requested.
---@field public bUseFieldOfViewForLOD boolean @If true, account for the field of view angle when computing which level of detail to use for meshes.
---@field public ProjectionMode integer @The type of camera
---@field public PostProcessBlendWeight number @Indicates if PostProcessSettings should be applied.
---@field public PostProcessSettings FPostProcessSettings @Post-process settings to use if PostProcessBlendWeight is non-zero.
---@field public OffCenterProjectionOffset FVector2D @Off-axis / off-center projection offset as proportion of screen dimensions
