---@field public LevelIndex integer @* Level scope index of this texture. It is used to reduce the amount of lookup to map a texture to its level index. * Useful when building texture streaming data, as well as when filling the texture streamer with precomputed data. * It relates to FStreamingTextureBuildInfo::TextureLevelIndex and also the index in ULevel::StreamingTextureGuids. * Default value of -1, indicates that the texture has an unknown index (not yet processed). At level load time, * -2 is also used to indicate that the texture has been processed but no entry were found in the level table. * After any of these processes, the LevelIndex is reset to INDEX_NONE. Making it ready for the next level task.

---@field public Availability ETextureAvailability @Whether the texture will be encoded to a gpu format and uploaded to the graphics card, or kept on the CPU for access by gamecode / blueprint.

---@field public SRGB boolean @Whether Texture and its source are in SRGB Gamma color space.  Can only be used with 8-bit and compressed formats.  This should be unchecked if using alpha channels individually as masks.
---@field public bNormalizeNormals boolean @Normalize colors in Normal Maps after mip generation for better and sharper quality; recommended on if not required to match legacy behavior.
