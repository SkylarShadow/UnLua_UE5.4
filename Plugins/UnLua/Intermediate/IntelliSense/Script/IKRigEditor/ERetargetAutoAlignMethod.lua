---A Note on Determining the "Direction" of a Bone...
---What are we using to determine the "direction" of the source and target bones to align?
---If chain only has one bone OR this bone is located at the end of a chain, then we cannot compute a tangent!
---So we fallback to an analysis of the geometry... this is necessary because we cannot rely solely on the shape of the skeleton.
---Any assumptions we make could be invalidated in different circumstances. For example,
---1. we cannot assume the local axes are aligned in any meaningful way, and even if they are we cannot assume WHICH axis is the correct one
---2. we cannot assume that any child bones are located in a position that would create a meaningful vector (ie twist bones in arbitrary locations)
---3. we cannot assume that extrapolating the direction from the parent is meaningful. For example, feet are usually perpendicular to the knee.
---Since the skeleton cannot be relied upon to provide robust directional information for individual and/or leaf bones, we must instead fallback
---on looking at the mesh that is skinned to it and try to discern a direction vector from that. If there is no skinning data, then we simply
---do NOT auto-align that bone.
