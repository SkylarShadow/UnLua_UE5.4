---@class UBlueprintEditorProjectSettings : UDeveloperSettings
---@field public bForceAllDependenciesToRecompile boolean
---@field public bValidateUnloadedSoftActorReferences boolean @If enabled, the editor will load packages to look for soft references to actors when deleting/renaming them. This can be slow in large projects so disable this to improve performance but increase the chance of breaking blueprints/sequences that use soft actor references
---@field public bEnableChildActorExpansionInTreeView boolean @Enable the option to expand child actor components within component tree views (experimental).
---@field public DefaultChildActorTreeViewMode EChildActorComponentTreeViewVisualizationMode @Default view mode to use for child actor components in a Blueprint actor's component tree hierarchy (experimental).
---@field public NamespacesToAlwaysInclude TArray<string> @A list of namespace identifiers that all Blueprint assets in the project should import by default. Requires Blueprint namespace features to be enabled in editor preferences. Editing this list will also cause any visible Blueprint editor windows to be closed.
---@field public DisabledCompilerMessagesExceptEditor TArray<string> @List of compiler messages that have been suppressed outside of full, interactive editor sessions for the current project - useful for silencing warnings that were added to the engine after project inception and are going to be addressed as they are found by content authors
---@field public DisabledCompilerMessages TArray<string> @List of compiler messages that have been suppressed completely - message suppression is only advisable when using blueprints that you cannot update and are raising innocuous warnings. If useless messages are being raised prefer to contact support rather than disabling messages
---@field public SuppressedDeprecationMessages TArray<string> @List of deprecated UProperties/UFunctions to supress warning messages for - useful for source changes that would otherwise cause content warnings The easiest way to populate this list is using the context menu on nodes with deprecated references
---@field public BaseClassesToAllowRecompilingDuringPlayInEditor TArray<TSoftClassPtr<UObject>> @Any blueprint deriving from one of these base classes will be allowed to recompile during Play-in-Editor (This setting exists both as an editor preference and project setting, and will be allowed if listed in either place)
---@field public bDisallowEditorUtilityBlueprintFunctionsInDetailsView boolean @Disallow call-in-editor functions in Editor Utility Blueprint assets from adding buttons to the Details view when an instance of the Blueprint is selected. expose this option and allow users to opt the project back into the legacy path until it can be fully deprecated.
