---An enum to control how to handle UE phantom tracks.
---A phantom tracks are present in an animation sequence but aren't mapped to skeleton bones.
---As such, they cannot be queried by the engine except manually through DecompressBone.
---It should generally be safe to Strip them but we default to Ignore.
---Re-importing the animation sequence should clean up any such stale data.
---@class ACLPhantomTrackMode
---@field public Ignore integer
---@field public Strip integer
---@field public Warn integer
