---@field protected bIsActionForBlueprints boolean @Is this action designed to work specifically on Blueprints (true) or on all assets (false). If true, SupportedClasses is treated as a filter against the Parent Class of selected Blueprint assets.
---@field protected SupportedClasses TArray<TSoftClassPtr<UObject>> @The supported classes controls the list of classes that may be operated on by all of the asset functions in this utility class.
---@field protected SupportedConditions TArray<FAssetActionSupportCondition> @The supported conditions for any asset to use these utility functions.  Note: all of these conditions must pass in sequence.  So if you have earlier failure conditions you want to be run first, put them first in the list, if those fail, their failure reason will be handled first.
