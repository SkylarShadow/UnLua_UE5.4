---@field public IKFootBone FBoneReference
---@field public FKFootBone FBoneReference
---@field public NumBonesInLimb integer
---@field public MinRotationAngle number @Only used if bEnableRotationLimit is enabled. Prevents the leg from folding onto itself, and forces at least this angle between Parent and Child bone.
---@field public FootBoneForwardAxis integer @Forward Axis for Foot bone.
---@field public HingeRotationAxis integer @Hinge Bones Rotation Axis. This is essentially the plane normal for (hip - knee - foot).
---@field public bEnableRotationLimit boolean @If enabled, we prevent the leg from bending backwards and enforce a min compression angle
---@field public bEnableKneeTwistCorrection boolean @Enable Knee Twist correction, by comparing Foot FK with Foot IK orientation.
---@field public TwistOffsetCurveName string @Name of the curve to use as the twist offset angle(in degrees). This is useful for injecting knee motion, while keeping the IK chain's goal/hand and root/hip locked in place. Reasonable values are usually between -+15 degrees, although this is depends on how far in/out the knee is in the original pose.
