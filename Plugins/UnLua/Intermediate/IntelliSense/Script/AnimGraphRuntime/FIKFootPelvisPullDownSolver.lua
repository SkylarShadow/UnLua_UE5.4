---@class FIKFootPelvisPullDownSolver
---@field public PelvisAdjustmentInterp FVectorRK4SpringInterpolator @Specifies the spring interpolation parameters applied during pelvis adjustment
---@field public PelvisAdjustmentInterpAlpha number @Specifies an alpha between the original and final adjusted pelvis locations This is used to retain some degree of the original pelvis motion
---@field public PelvisAdjustmentMaxDistance number @Specifies the maximum displacement the pelvis can be adjusted relative to its original location
---@field public PelvisAdjustmentErrorTolerance number @Specifies the pelvis adjustment distance error that is tolerated for each iteration of the solver When it is detected that the pelvis adjustment distance is incrementing at a value lower or equal to this value for each iteration, the solve will halt. Lower values will marginally increase visual quality at the cost of performance, but may require a higher PelvisAdjustmentMaxIter to be specified The default value of 0.01 specifies 1 centimeter of error
---@field public PelvisAdjustmentMaxIter integer @Specifies the maximum number of iterations to run for the pelvis adjustment solver Higher iterations will guarantee closer PelvisAdjustmentErrorTolerance convergence at the cost of performance
