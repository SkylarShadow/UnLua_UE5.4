---@class FPBIKBoneSetting
---@field public Bone string @The Bone that these settings will be applied to.
---@field public RotationStiffness number @Range is 0 to 1 (Default is 0). At higher values, the bone will resist rotating (forcing other bones to compensate).
---@field public PositionStiffness number @Range is 0 to 1 (Default is 0). At higher values, the bone will resist translational motion (forcing other bones to compensate).
---@field public X EPBIKLimitType @Limit the rotation angle of the bone on the X axis. Free: can rotate freely in this axis. Limited: rotation is clamped between the min/max angles relative to the Skeletal Mesh reference pose. Locked: no rotation is allowed in this axis (will remain at reference pose angle).
---@field public MinX number @Range is -180 to 0 (Default is 0). Degrees of rotation in the negative X direction to allow when joint is in "Limited" mode.
---@field public MaxX number @Range is 0 to 180 (Default is 0). Degrees of rotation in the positive X direction to allow when joint is in "Limited" mode.
---@field public Y EPBIKLimitType @Limit the rotation angle of the bone on the Y axis. Free: can rotate freely in this axis. Limited: rotation is clamped between the min/max angles relative to the Skeletal Mesh reference pose. Locked: no rotation is allowed in this axis (will remain at input pose angle).
---@field public MinY number @Range is -180 to 0 (Default is 0). Degrees of rotation in the negative Y direction to allow when joint is in "Limited" mode.
---@field public MaxY number @Range is 0 to 180 (Default is 0). Degrees of rotation in the positive Y direction to allow when joint is in "Limited" mode.
---@field public Z EPBIKLimitType @Limit the rotation angle of the bone on the Z axis. Free: can rotate freely in this axis. Limited: rotation is clamped between the min/max angles relative to the Skeletal Mesh reference pose. Locked: no rotation is allowed in this axis (will remain at input pose angle).
---@field public MinZ number @Range is -180 to 0 (Default is 0). Degrees of rotation in the negative Z direction to allow when joint is in "Limited" mode.
---@field public MaxZ number @Range is 0 to 180 (Default is 0). Degrees of rotation in the positive Z direction to allow when joint is in "Limited" mode.
---@field public bUsePreferredAngles boolean @When true, this bone will "prefer" to rotate in the direction specified by the Preferred Angles when the chain it belongs to is compressed. Preferred Angles should be the first method used to fix bones that bend in the wrong direction (rather than limits). The resulting angles can be visualized on their own by temporarily setting the Solver iterations to 0 and moving the effectors.
---@field public PreferredAngles FVector @The local Euler angles (in degrees) used to rotate this bone when the chain it belongs to is squashed. This happens by moving the effector at the tip of the chain towards the root of the chain. This can be used to coerce knees and elbows to bend in the anatomically "correct" direction without resorting to limits (which may require more iterations to converge).
