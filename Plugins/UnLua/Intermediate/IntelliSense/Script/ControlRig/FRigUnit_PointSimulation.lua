---@field public bLimitLocalPosition boolean @If set to true bones are placed within the original distance of the previous local transform. This can be used to avoid stretch.
---@field public bPropagateToChildren boolean @If set to true all of the global transforms of the children of this bone will be recalculated based on their local transforms. Note: This is computationally more expensive than turning it off.
