---Animation node that allows animation ControlRig output to be used in an animation graph
---@class FAnimNode_ControlRigBase : FAnimNode_CustomProperty
---@field protected Source FPoseLink
---@field protected bResetInputPoseToInitial boolean @If this is checked the rig's pose needs to be reset to its initial prior to evaluating the rig.
---@field protected bTransferInputPose boolean @If this is checked the bone pose coming from the AnimBP will be transferred into the Control Rig.
---@field protected bTransferInputCurves boolean @If this is checked the curves coming from the AnimBP will be transferred into the Control Rig.
---@field protected bTransferPoseInGlobalSpace boolean @Transferring the pose in global space guarantees a global pose match, while transferring in local space ensures a match of the local transforms. In general transforms only differ if the hierarchy topology differs between the Control Rig and the skeleton used in the AnimBP. Note: Turning this off can potentially improve performance.
---@field protected InputBonesToTransfer TArray<FBoneReference> @An inclusive list of bones to transfer as part of the input pose transfer phase. If this list is empty all bones will be transferred.
---@field protected OutputBonesToTransfer TArray<FBoneReference> @An inclusive list of bones to transfer as part of the output pose transfer phase. If this list is empty all bones will be transferred.
---@field protected AssetUserData TArray<UAssetUserData>
