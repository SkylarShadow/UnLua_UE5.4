---Sweeps a sphere against the world and return the first blocking hit using a specific channel. Target objects can have different object types, but they need to have the same trace channel set to "block" in their collision response settings.
---You can create custom trace channels in Project Setting - Collision.

---@field public Radius number @Radius of the sphere to use for sweeping / tracing
