---Solves the two bone IK given two bones.
---Note: This node operates in world space!
---@class FRigUnit_TwoBoneIKSimple : FRigUnit_HighlevelBaseMutable
---@field public BoneA string @The name of first bone
---@field public BoneB string @The name of second bone
---@field public EffectorBone string @The name of the effector bone (if exists)
---@field public Effector FTransform @The transform of the effector
---@field public PrimaryAxis FVector @The major axis being aligned - along the bone
---@field public SecondaryAxis FVector @The minor axis being aligned - towards the polevector
---@field public SecondaryAxisWeight number @Determines how much the secondary axis roll is being applied
---@field public PoleVector FVector @The polevector to use for the IK solver This can be a location or direction.
---@field public PoleVectorKind EControlRigVectorKind @The kind of pole vector this is representing - can be a direction or a location
---@field public PoleVectorSpace string @The space in which the pole vector is expressed
---@field public bEnableStretch boolean @If set to true the stretch feature of the solver will be enabled
---@field public StretchStartRatio number @The ratio where the stretch starts
---@field public StretchMaximumRatio number @The maximum allowed stretch ratio
---@field public Weight number @The weight of the solver - how much the IK should be applied.
---@field public BoneALength number @The length of the first bone. If set to 0.0 it will be determined by the hierarchy
---@field public BoneBLength number @The length of the second  bone. If set to 0.0 it will be determined by the hierarchy
---@field public bPropagateToChildren boolean @If set to true all of the global transforms of the children of this bone will be recalculated based on their local transforms. Note: This is computationally more expensive than turning it off.
---@field public DebugSettings FRigUnit_TwoBoneIKSimple_DebugSettings @The settings for debug drawing
