---Solves the two bone IK given two bones.
---Note: This node operates in world space!
---@class FRigUnit_TwoBoneIKSimplePerItem : FRigUnit_HighlevelBaseMutable
---@field public ItemA FRigElementKey @The name of first item
---@field public ItemB FRigElementKey @The name of second item
---@field public EffectorItem FRigElementKey @The name of the effector item (if exists)
---@field public Effector FTransform @The transform of the effector
---@field public PrimaryAxis FVector @The major axis being aligned - along the item
---@field public SecondaryAxis FVector @The minor axis being aligned - towards the polevector
---@field public SecondaryAxisWeight number @Determines how much the secondary axis roll is being applied
---@field public PoleVector FVector @The polevector to use for the IK solver This can be a location or direction.
---@field public PoleVectorKind EControlRigVectorKind @The kind of pole vector this is representing - can be a direction or a location
---@field public PoleVectorSpace FRigElementKey @The space in which the pole vector is expressed
---@field public bEnableStretch boolean @If set to true the stretch feature of the solver will be enabled
---@field public StretchStartRatio number @The ratio where the stretch starts
---@field public StretchMaximumRatio number @The maximum allowed stretch ratio
---@field public Weight number @The weight of the solver - how much the IK should be applied.
---@field public ItemALength number @The length of the first item. If set to 0.0 it will be determined by the hierarchy
---@field public ItemBLength number @The length of the second item. If set to 0.0 it will be determined by the hierarchy
---@field public bPropagateToChildren boolean @If set to true all of the global transforms of the children of this bone will be recalculated based on their local transforms. Note: This is computationally more expensive than turning it off.
