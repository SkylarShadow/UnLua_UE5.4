---Aligns the rotation of a primary and secondary axis of a bone to a global target.
---Note: This node operates in global space!
---@class FRigUnit_AimBone : FRigUnit_HighlevelBaseMutable
---@field public Bone string @The name of the bone to align
---@field public Primary FRigUnit_AimBone_Target @The primary target for the aim
---@field public Secondary FRigUnit_AimBone_Target @The secondary target for the aim - also referred to as PoleVector / UpVector
---@field public Weight number @The weight of the change - how much the change should be applied
---@field public bPropagateToChildren boolean @If set to true all of the global transforms of the children of this bone will be recalculated based on their local transforms. Note: This is computationally more expensive than turning it off.
---@field public DebugSettings FRigUnit_AimBone_DebugSettings @The debug setting for the node
---@field public CachedBoneIndex FCachedRigElement
---@field public PrimaryCachedSpace FCachedRigElement
---@field public SecondaryCachedSpace FCachedRigElement
