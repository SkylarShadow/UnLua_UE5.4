---* Outputs a float value between 0-1 based off of the driver item's rotation in a specified region.
---@class FRigUnit_SphericalPoseReader : FRigUnit_HighlevelBaseMutable
---@field public OutputParam number @The normalized output parameter; ranges from 0 (when outside yellow region) to 1 (in the green region) and smoothly blends from 0-1 in the yellow region.
---@field public DriverItem FRigElementKey @The bone that will drive the output parameter when rotated into the active regions of this pose reader.
---@field public DriverAxis FVector @The axis of the driver transform that is compared against the falloff regions. Typically the axis that is pointing at the child; usually X by convention. Default is X-axis (1,0,0).
---@field public RotationOffset FVector @Rotate the entire falloff region to align with the desired area of effect.
---@field public ActiveRegionSize number @The size of the active region (green) that outputs the full value (1.0). Range is 0-1. Default is 0.1.
---@field public ActiveRegionScaleFactors FRegionScaleFactors @The directional scaling parameters for the active region (green).
---@field public FalloffSize number @The size of the falloff region (yellow) that defines the start of the output range. A value of 1 wraps the entire sphere with falloff. Range is 0-1. Default is 0.2.
---@field public FalloffRegionScaleFactors FRegionScaleFactors @The directional scaling parameters for the falloff region (yellow).
---@field public FlipWidthScaling boolean @Flip the positive / negative directions of the width scale factors.
---@field public FlipHeightScaling boolean @Flip the positive / negative directions of the height scale factors.
---@field public OptionalParentItem FRigElementKey @An optional parent to use as a stable frame of reference for the active regions (defaults to DriverItem's parent if unset).
