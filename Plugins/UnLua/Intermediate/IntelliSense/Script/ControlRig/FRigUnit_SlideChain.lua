---Slides an existing chain along itself with control over extrapolation.

---@field public StartBone string @The name of the first bone to slide

---@field public SlideAmount number @The amount of sliding. This unit is multiple of the chain length.
---@field public bPropagateToChildren boolean @If set to true all of the global transforms of the children of this bone will be recalculated based on their local transforms. Note: This is computationally more expensive than turning it off.
