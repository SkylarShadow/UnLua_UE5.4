---UStaticMeshLODGenerationSettings is intended to be a stored version of the settings used
---by UGenerateStaticMeshLODProcess (and the associated UGenerateStaticMeshLODAssetTool).
---This UObject is exposed as an Asset type in the Editor via UStaticMeshLODGenerationSettingsFactory.
---The Tool uses these serialized settings as a 'Preset', ie the user can save a set
---of configured settings, or load previously-saved settings.
