---@field public bDeveloperMode boolean @Should Developer Mode be enabled on the Python interpreter? (will also enable extra warnings (e.g., for deprecated code), and enable stub code generation for use with external IDEs).
---@field public TypeHintingMode ETypeHintingMode @Should the generated Python stub and API documentation have type hints. This enables standard Python type hinting (PEP 484) for the classes, structs, methods, properties, constants, etc. exposed by the engine. If the developer mode is enabled and the Python IDE configured to use the generated Python stub, types will be displayed in auto-completion popup and used by the IDE static type checkers. This has no effects on the execution of the code. (Requires Python >= 3.7)
