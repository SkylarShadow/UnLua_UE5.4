---Attempts to pull all virtualized content in the current project. Since the virtualization
---system will push any payloads pulled from persistent storage to cached storage this
---has the side effect of making sure that all payloads are stored in cached storage. This
---can be used to reduce the cost of virtualized payload access for a user at the cost of
---disk space.
---Because the commandlet is the VirtualizationEditor module it needs to be invoked
---with the command line:
----run="VirtualizationEditor.PrecachePayloads"
---@class UPrecachePayloadsCommandlet : UCommandlet
local UPrecachePayloadsCommandlet = {}
