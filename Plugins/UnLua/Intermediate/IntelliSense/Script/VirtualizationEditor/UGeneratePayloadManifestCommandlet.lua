---Creates a csv file containing info about all of the payloads in a set of packages.
---By default the commandlet will parse the payloads of all packages in the current
---project but this can be overridden with the cmdline switch -PackageDir=XYZ which
---will allow the commandlet to parse the payloads of the packages in a given directory.
---Because the commandlet is the VirtualizationEditor module it needs to be invoked
---with the command line:
----run="VirtualizationEditor.GeneratePayloadManifest"
---@class UGeneratePayloadManifestCommandlet : UCommandlet
local UGeneratePayloadManifestCommandlet = {}
