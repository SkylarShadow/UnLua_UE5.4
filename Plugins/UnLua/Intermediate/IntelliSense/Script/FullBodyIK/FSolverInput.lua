---@class FSolverInput
---@field public LinearMotionStrength number @* This value is applied to the target information for effectors, which influence back to * Joint's motion that are affected by the end effector * The reason min/max is used when we apply the depth through the chain that are affected
---@field public MinLinearMotionStrength number
---@field public AngularMotionStrength number @* This value is applied to the target information for effectors, which influence back to * Joint's motion that are affected by the end effector * The reason min/max is used when we apply the depth through the chain that are affected
---@field public MinAngularMotionStrength number
---@field public DefaultTargetClamp number @This is a scale value (range from 0-0.7) that is used to stablize the target vector. If less, it's more stable, but it can reduce speed of converge.
---@field public Precision number @The precision to use for the solver
---@field public Damping number @The precision to use for the fabrik solver
---@field public MaxIterations integer @The maximum number of iterations. Values between 4 and 16 are common.
---@field public bUseJacobianTranspose boolean @Cheaper solution than default Jacobian Pseudo Inverse Damped Least Square
