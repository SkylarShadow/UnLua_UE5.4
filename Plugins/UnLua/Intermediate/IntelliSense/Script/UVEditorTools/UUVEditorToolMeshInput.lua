---A package of the needed information for an asset being operated on by a
---UV editor tool. It includes a UV unwrap mesh, a mesh with the UV layer applied,
---and background-op-compatible previews for each. It also has convenience methods
---for updating all of the represenations from just one of them, using a "fast update"
---code path when possible.
---This tool target is a bit different from usual in that it is not created
---by a tool target manager, and therefore doesn't have an accompanying factory.
---Instead, it is created by the mode, because the mode has access to the worlds
---in which the previews need to be created.
---It's arguable whether this should even inherit from UToolTarget.
---@class UUVEditorToolMeshInput : UToolTarget
---@field public UnwrapPreview UMeshOpPreviewWithBackgroundCompute @Preview of the unwrapped UV layer, suitable for being manipulated by background ops.
---@field public AppliedPreview UMeshOpPreviewWithBackgroundCompute @3d preview of the asset with the UV layer updated, suitable for use with background ops.
---@field public WireframeDisplay UMeshElementsVisualizer @Optional: a wireframe to track the mesh in unwrap preview. If set, it gets updated whenever the class updates the unwrap preview, and it is destroyed on Shutdown(). TODO: We should have a fast path for updating the wireframe...
---@field public bEnableTriangleVertexColors boolean @When enabled, this causes the unwrap preview to recieve updates to the vertex color buffers when mesh updates occur.
