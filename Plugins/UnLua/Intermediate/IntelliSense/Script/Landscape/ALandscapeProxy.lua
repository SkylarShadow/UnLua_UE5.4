---@field protected NanitePositionPrecision integer
---@field protected NaniteMaxEdgeLengthFactor number

---@field public MaxLODLevel integer @Max LOD level to use when rendering, -1 means the max available
---@field public ComponentScreenSizeToUseSubSections number
---@field public LOD0ScreenSize number @This is the starting screen size used to calculate the distribution. You can increase the value if you want less LOD0 component, and you use very large landscape component.
---@field public LODGroupKey integer @Specifies the LOD Group (Zero is No Group). All landscapes in the same group calculate their LOD together, allowing matching border LODs to fix geometry seams.

---@field public bVirtualTextureRenderWithQuad boolean @Use a single quad to render this landscape to runtime virtual texture pages. This is the fastest path but it only gives correct results if the runtime virtual texture orientation is aligned with the landscape. If the two are unaligned we need to render to the virtual texture using LODs with sufficient density.
---@field public bVirtualTextureRenderWithQuadHQ boolean @Use highest quality heightmap interpolation when using a single quad to render this landscape to runtime virtual texture pages. This also requires the project setting: r.VT.RVT.HighQualityPerPixelHeight.

---@field public VirtualTextureRenderPassType ERuntimeVirtualTextureMainPassType @Controls if this component draws in the main pass as well as in the virtual texture.
---@field public NegativeZBoundsExtension number @Allows overriding the landscape bounds.

---@field public PositiveZBoundsExtension number @Allows overriding the landscape bounds.

---@field public ShadowCacheInvalidationBehavior EShadowCacheInvalidationBehavior @Control shadow invalidation behavior, in particular with respect to Virtual Shadow Maps and material effects like World Position Offset.
---@field public bCastContactShadow boolean @Whether the object should cast contact shadows. This flag is only used if CastShadow is true.
---@field public bCastFarShadow boolean @When enabled, the component will be rendering into the far shadow cascades(only for directional lights).  This flag is only used if CastShadow is true.
---@field public bCastHiddenShadow boolean @If true, the primitive will cast shadows even if bHidden is true.  Controls whether the primitive should cast shadows when hidden.  This flag is only used if CastShadow is true.
---@field public bCastShadowAsTwoSided boolean @Whether this primitive should cast dynamic shadows as if it were a two sided material.  This flag is only used if CastShadow is true.
---@field public bAffectDistanceFieldLighting boolean @Controls whether the primitive should affect dynamic distance field lighting methods.  This flag is only used if CastShadow is true. *
---@field public LightingChannels FLightingChannels @Channels that this Landscape should be in.  Lights with matching channels will affect the Landscape. These channels only apply to opaque materials, direct lighting, and dynamic lighting and shadowing.
---@field public bUseMaterialPositionOffsetInStaticLighting boolean @Whether to use the landscape material's vertical world position offset when calculating static lighting. Note: Only z (vertical) offset is supported. XY offsets are ignored. Does not work correctly with an XY offset map (mesh collision)
---@field public NonNaniteVirtualShadowMapConstantDepthBias number @Constant bias to handle the worst artifacts of the continuous LOD morphing when rendering to VSM. Only applies when using non-Nanite landscape and VSM.
---@field public NonNaniteVirtualShadowMapInvalidationHeightErrorThreshold number @For non-Nanite landscape, cached VSM pages need to be invalidated when continuous LOD morphing introduces a height difference that is too large between the current landscape component's profile and the one that was used when the shadow was shadow was last cached. This height threshold (in Unreal units) controls this invalidation rate (a smaller threshold will reduce the likeliness of shadow artifacts, but will make the invalidations occur more frequently, which is not desirable in terms of performance. Disabled if 0.0. Only applies when using non-Nanite landscape and VSM.
---@field public NonNaniteVirtualShadowMapInvalidationScreenSizeLimit number @Screen size under which VSM invalidation stops occurring. As the height difference between 2 mip levels increases when the LOD level increases (because of undersampling), VSM pages tend to be invalidated more frequently even though it's getting less and less relevant to do so, since this will mean that the screen size of the landscape section decreases, thus the artifacts actually become less noticeable. We therefore artificially attenuate the VSM invalidation rate as the screen size decreases, to avoid invalidating VSM pages too often, as it becomes less and less impactful. A higher value will accentuate this attenuation (better performance but more artifacts) and vice versa. If 0.0, the attenuation of the VSM invalidation rate will be disabled entirely. Only applies when using non-Nanite landscape and VSM.

---@field public LightmassSettings FLightmassPrimitiveSettings @The Lightmass settings for this object.
---@field public CollisionMipLevel integer @Landscape LOD to use for collision tests. Higher numbers use less memory and process faster, but are much less accurate
---@field public SimpleCollisionMipLevel integer @If set higher than the "Collision Mip Level", this specifies the Landscape LOD to use for "simple collision" tests, otherwise the "Collision Mip Level" is used for both simple and complex collision. Does not work with an XY offset map (mesh collision)
---@field public BodyInstance FBodyInstance @Collision profile settings for this landscape
---@field public bGenerateOverlapEvents boolean @If true, Landscape will generate overlap events when other components are overlapping it (eg Begin Overlap). Both the Landscape and the other component must have this flag enabled for overlap events to occur.
---@field public bBakeMaterialPositionOffsetIntoCollision boolean @Whether to bake the landscape material's vertical world position offset into the collision heightfield.
