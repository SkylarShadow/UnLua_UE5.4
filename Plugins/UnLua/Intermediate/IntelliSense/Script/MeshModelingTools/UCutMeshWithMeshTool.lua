---UCutMeshWithMeshTool cuts an input mesh into two pieces based on a second input mesh.
---Essentially this just both a Boolean Subtract and a Boolean Intersection. However
---doing those as two separate operations involves quite a few steps, so this Tool
---does it in a single step and with some improved efficiency.
