---@class FAnimNode_RetargetPoseFromMesh : FAnimNode_Base
---@field public SourceMeshComponent TWeakObjectPtr<USkeletalMeshComponent> @The Skeletal Mesh Component to retarget animation from. Assumed to be animated and tick BEFORE this anim instance.
---@field public bUseAttachedParent boolean @If SourceMeshComponent is not valid, and if this is true, it will look for attached parent as a source
---@field public IKRetargeterAsset UIKRetargeter @Retarget asset to use. Must define a Source and Target IK Rig compatible with the SourceMeshComponent and current anim instance.
---@field public CustomRetargetProfile FRetargetProfile @connect a custom retarget profile to modify the retargeter's settings at runtime.
---@field public bSuppressWarnings boolean @Toggle whether to print warnings about missing or incorrectly configured retarget configurations.
---@field public bCopyCurves boolean @Copy curves from SouceMeshComponent. This will copy any curves the source/target Skeleton have in common.
---@field public LODThreshold integer @* Max LOD that this node is allowed to run. * For example if you have LODThreshold at 2, it will run until LOD 2 (based on 0 index) when the component LOD becomes 3, it will stop update/evaluate * A value of -1 forces the node to execute at all LOD levels.
---@field public LODThresholdForIK integer @* Max LOD that IK is allowed to run. * For example if you have LODThresholdForIK at 2, it will skip the IK pass on LODs 3 and greater. * This only disables IK and does not affect the Root or FK passes. * A value of -1 forces the node to execute at all LOD levels.
---@field private Processor UIKRetargetProcessor @the runtime processor used to run the retarget and generate new poses
