---@class FTargetChainIKSettings
---@field public EnableIK boolean @Whether to modify the location of the IK goal on this chain. Default is true. NOTE: This only has an effect if the chain has an IK Goal assigned to it in the Target IK Rig asset. NOTE: If off, and this chain has an IK Goal, the IK will still be evaluated, but the Goal is set to the input bone location (from the FK pass).
---@field public BlendToSource number @Range 0 to 1. Default 0. Blends IK goal position from retargeted location (0) to source bone location (1). At 0 the goal is placed at the retargeted location. At 1 the goal is placed at the location of the source chain's end bone.
---@field public BlendToSourceWeights FVector @Range 0 to 1. Default 1. Weight each axis separately when using Blend To Source. At 0 the goal is placed at the retargeted location. At 1 the goal is placed at the location of the source chain's end bone.
---@field public StaticOffset FVector @Default 0, 0, 0. Apply a static global-space offset to IK goal position.
---@field public StaticLocalOffset FVector @Default 0, 0, 0. Apply a static local-space offset to IK goal position.
---@field public StaticRotationOffset FRotator @Default 0, 0, 0. Apply a static local-space offset to IK goal rotation.
---@field public ScaleVertical number @Range +-Infinity. Default 1. Scales the vertical component of the IK goal's position.
---@field public Extension number @Range 0 to 5. Default 1. Brings IK goal closer (0) or further (1+) from origin of chain. At 0 the effector is placed at the origin of the chain (ie Shoulder, Hip etc). At 1 the effector is left at the end of the chain (ie Wrist, Foot etc) Values in-between 0-1 will slide the effector along the vector from the start to the end of the chain. Values greater than 1 will stretch the chain beyond the retargeted length.
---@field public bAffectedByIKWarping boolean @Is this IK goal affected by the stride warping (in Global Settings). Typically this is true for all feet, but not for hands.
