---World metrics subsystem
---This subsystem provides an interface to add and remove world metrics implementing the UWorldMetricInterface class.
---- Added metrics get automatically updated by the subsystem's ticker.
---- The subsystem becomes an owner of all added metrics. The user is responsible for removing them when no longer
---  needed so they can be garbage collected.
---- Metrics can have extensions to add shared functionality.
---- Extensions implement the UWorldMetricsExtension class and use Acquire/Release semantics. They can be acquired by
---  either metrics or extensions. Initialization and deinitialization are the ideal phases to do so.
---- The subsystem solely owns extensions and can automatically remove them for garbage collection whenever they are no
---  longer acquired by any metric or extension.
