---A list of script element handles (proxy to a FScriptTypedElementList instance).
---Provides high-level access to groups of elements, including accessing elements that implement specific interfaces.
---Note: the script list proxy use should be avoided when not using it for the script exposure apis.
---The weak model for the handles come with an additional cost to the runtime performance and the memory usage.
---@class FScriptTypedElementListProxy
local FScriptTypedElementListProxy = {}
