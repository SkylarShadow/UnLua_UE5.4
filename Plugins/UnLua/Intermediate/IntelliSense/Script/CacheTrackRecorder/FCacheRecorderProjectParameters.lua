---@field public RecordingClockSource EUpdateClockSource @The clock source to use when recording
---@field public bStartAtCurrentTimecode boolean @If enabled, track sections will start at the current timecode. Otherwise, 0.
---@field public bRecordTimecode boolean @If enabled, timecode will be recorded into each actor track
---@field public bShowNotifications boolean @Whether to show notification windows or not when recording
