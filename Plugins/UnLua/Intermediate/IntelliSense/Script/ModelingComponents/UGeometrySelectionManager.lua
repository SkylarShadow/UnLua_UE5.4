---UGeometrySelectionManager provides the infrastructure for "Element Selection", ie
---geometric sub-elements of some geometry object like a Triangle Mesh. The Manager is
---designed to work with a relatively vague concept of "element", so it doesn't explicitly
---reference triangles/etc, and the selectable-elements and how-elements-are-selected
---concepts are provided by abstract-interfaces that allow various implememtations.
---The "Geometry Objects", eg like a DynamicMeshComponent, Gameplay Volume, etc, are
---referred to as "Active Targets" in the Manager. External code provides and updates
---the set of Active Targets, eg for example tracking the active Actor Selection in the Editor.
---For a given Target, a tuple (Selector, Selection, SelectionEditor) is created and maintained.
---The FGeometrySelection is ultimately a basic list of integers and does not have any knowledge
---of what it is a selection *of*, and is not intended to be directly edited. Instead the
---SelectionEditor provides that functionality. This separation allows "selection editing" to
---be customized, eg to enforce invariants or constraints that might apply to certain kinds of selections.
---The IGeometrySelector provides the core implementation of what "selection" means for a given
---Target, eg like a mesh Component, or mesh object like a UDynamicMesh. The Selector is
---created by a registered Factory, allowing client code to provide custom implementations for
---different Target Types. Updates to the Selection are done via the Selector, as well as queries
---about (eg) renderable selection geometry. 3D Transforms are also applied via the Selector,
---as only it has the knowledge about what can be transformed and how it can be applied.
---The GeometrySelectionManager provides high-level interfaces for this system, for example
---external code (eg such as something that creates a Gizmo for the active selection) only
---needs to interact with SelectionManager, calling functions like
---::BeginTransformation() / ::UpdateTransformation() / ::EndTransformation().
---The SelectionManager also handles Transactions/FChanges for the active Targets and Selections.
