---@class UGeometrySelectionVisualizationProperties : UInteractiveToolPropertySet
---@field public bEnableShowTriangleROIBorder boolean @This option should be enabled for tools in which the triangle color is reserved for some tool function.  The Generate PolyGroups tool, for example, uses triangle color to indicate the polygroup id. If true show a user option to visualize the geometry selection as the border of the triangles in the selection ROI (region of influence).
---@field public bEnableShowEdgeSelectionVertices boolean @This option should be enabled for tools that treat edge selections as if they were vertex selections containing all incident vertices.  See EditNormalsTool for an example.  For such tools seeing the vertex selection corresponding to the edges selection can be useful for understanding the output. If true  edge selections can be visualized as a line set or as a set of points touched by the selection If false edge selections are always visualized as a line set
