---* Mechanic for a PolyLasso "marquee" selection. It creates and maintains the 2D PolyLasso associated with a mouse drag.
---* It does not test against any scene geometry, nor does it maintain any sort of list of selected objects.
---*
---* The PolyLasso has two potential modes, a freehand polyline and a multi-click polygon. By default both are enabled
---* but this can be selectively controlled with flags below. If a click-and-release is within a small distance tolerance,
---* then a multi-click polygon is entered, and must be exited by clicking again at the start point. The freehand polyline
---* is drawn by click-dragging, and exited by releasing the mouse.
---*
---* When using this mechanic, you should call DrawHUD() in the tool's DrawHUD() call so that it can draw the box.
---*
---* Attach to the mechanic's delegates and use the passed PolyLasso to test against your geometry.

---@field public bEnableFreehandPolygons boolean @If true, freehand polygons can be drawn by click-dragging the mouse
---@field public bEnableMultiClickPolygons boolean @If true, if click and release are within SpacingTolerance, mechanic enters a multi-click mode, where each click adds a vertex to a polygon. Polygon must be closed by clicking within 2*SpacingTolerance of the initial point to exit this mode. However, rotating the camera will also cancel out of the interaction.
