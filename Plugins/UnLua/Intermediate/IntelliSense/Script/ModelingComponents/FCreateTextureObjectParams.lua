---FCreateTextureObjectParams is a collection of input data intended to be passed to
---UModelingObjectsCreationAPI::CreateTextureObject(). Not all data necessarily needs
---to be specified, this will depend on the particular implementation. The comments
---below are representative of how this data structure is used in the Tools and
---API implementation(s) provided with Unreal Engine, but end-user implementors
---could abuse these fields as necessary.
---The definition of a "texture object" is implementation-specific.
---In the UE Editor this is generally a UTexture2D
---@class FCreateTextureObjectParams
---@field public TypeHintExtended integer @An arbitrary integer that can be used to pass data to an API implementation
---@field public TargetWorld UWorld @The World/Level the new texture object should be created in (if known). Note that Textures generally do not exist as objects in a Level. However, it may be necessary to store the texture in a path relative to the level (for example if the level is in a Plugin, this would be necessary in-Editor)
---@field public StoreRelativeToObject UObject @An object to store the Texture relative to. For example the texture could be stored at the same path.
---@field public BaseName string @The base name of the new mesh object
---@field public GeneratedTransientTexture UTexture2D @Texture source data. Generally assumed that this is a Texture created in the Transient package that is intended to be saved in a permanent package.
