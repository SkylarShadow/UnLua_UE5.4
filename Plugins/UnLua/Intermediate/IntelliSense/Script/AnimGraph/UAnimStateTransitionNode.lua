---@class UAnimStateTransitionNode : UAnimStateNodeBase
---@field public BoundGraph UEdGraph @The transition logic graph for this transition (returning a boolean)
---@field public CustomTransitionGraph UEdGraph @The animation graph for this transition if it uses custom blending (returning a pose)
---@field public PriorityOrder integer @The priority order of this transition. If multiple transitions out of a state go true at the same time, the one with the smallest priority order will take precedent
---@field public CrossfadeDuration number @The duration to cross-fade for
---@field public BlendMode EAlphaBlendOption
---@field public CustomBlendCurve UCurveFloat
---@field public BlendProfile UBlendProfile @The blend profile to use to evaluate this transition per-bone
---@field public bAutomaticRuleBasedOnSequencePlayerInState boolean @Try setting the rule automatically based on most relevant asset player node's remaining time and the Automatic Rule Trigger Time of the transition, ignoring the internal time
---@field public AutomaticRuleTriggerTime number @When should the automatic transition rule trigger relative to the time remaining on the relevant asset player:  < 0 means trigger the transition 'Crossfade Duration' seconds before the end of the asset player, so a standard blend would finish just as the asset player ends >= 0 means trigger the transition 'Automatic Rule Trigger Time' seconds before the end of the asset player
---@field public SyncGroupNameToRequireValidMarkersRule string @If SyncGroupName is specified, Transition will only be taken if the SyncGroup has valid markers (other transition rules still apply in addition to that).
---@field public LogicType integer @What transition logic to use
---@field public TransitionStart FAnimNotifyEvent
---@field public TransitionEnd FAnimNotifyEvent
---@field public TransitionInterrupt FAnimNotifyEvent
---@field public Bidirectional boolean @This transition can go both directions
---@field public bSharedRules boolean @The rules for this transition may be shared with other transition nodes
---@field public bSharedCrossfade boolean @The cross-fade settings of this node may be shared
---@field public SharedRulesName string @What we call this transition if we are shared ('Transition X to Y' can't be used since its used in multiple places)
---@field public SharedRulesGuid FGuid @Shared rules guid useful when copying between different state machines
---@field public SharedColor FLinearColor @Color we draw in the editor as if we are shared
---@field public SharedCrossfadeName string
---@field public SharedCrossfadeGuid FGuid
---@field public SharedCrossfadeIdx integer
