---Base UAssetEditor class for character simulation asset editors (e.g. cloth, hair, flesh).
---Our current asset editor guidelines ask us to place as little business logic as possible
---into the class, instead putting as much of the non-UI code into the subsystem as possible,
---and the UI code into the toolkit (which this class owns).
---However, since we're using a mode and the Interactive Tools Framework, a lot of our business logic
---ends up inside the mode and the tools, not the subsystem. The front-facing code is mostly in
---the asset editor toolkit, though the mode toolkit has most of the things that deal with the toolbar
---on the left.
