---ANavLinkProxy connects areas of Navmesh that don't have a direct navigation path.
---It directly supports Simple Links (see PointLinks array). There can be multiple Simple links per ANavLinkProxy instance.
---Simple links are designed to statically link areas of Navmesh and are associated with a particular area class that the link provides.
---Smart Link functionality is provided via UNavLinkCustomComponent, see SmartLinkComp. They are designed to be able to be dynamically toggled
---between enabled and disabled and provide different area classes for both cases. The area classes can be dynamically modified
---without navmesh rebuilds.
---There can only be at most one smart link per ANavLinkProxy instance.
---Both simple and smart links on a single ANavLinkProxy instance, can be set / enabled at once, as well as either or neither of them.
