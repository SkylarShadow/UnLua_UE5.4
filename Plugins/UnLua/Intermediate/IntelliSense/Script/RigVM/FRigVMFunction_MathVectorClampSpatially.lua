---Clamps a position using a plane collision, cylindric collision or spherical collision.
---The collision happens both towards an inner envelope (minimum) and towards an outer envelope (maximum).
---You can disable the inner / outer envelope / collision by setting the minimum / maximum to 0.0.

---@field public Value FVector
---@field public Axis integer
---@field public Type integer
---@field public Minimum number @The minimum allowed distance at which a collision occurs. Note: For capsule this represents the radius. Disable by setting to 0.0.
---@field public Maximum number @This maximum allowed distance. A collision will occur towards the center at this wall. Note: For capsule this represents the length. Disable by setting to 0.0.
---@field public Space FTransform @The space this spatial clamp happens within. The input position will be projected into this space.
