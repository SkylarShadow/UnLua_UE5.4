---Clamps a position using a plane collision, cylindric collision or spherical collision.
---@class FRigVMFunction_MathTransformClampSpatially : FRigVMFunction_MathTransformBase
---@field public Value FTransform
---@field public Axis integer
---@field public Type integer
---@field public Minimum number @The minimum allowed distance at which a collision occurs. Note: For capsule this represents the radius. Disable by setting to 0.0.
---@field public Maximum number @This maximum allowed distance. A collision will occur towards the center at this wall. Note: For capsule this represents the length. Disable by setting to 0.0.
---@field public Space FTransform @The space this spatial clamp happens within. The input position will be projected into this space.
---@field public bDrawDebug boolean
---@field public DebugColor FLinearColor
---@field public DebugThickness number
