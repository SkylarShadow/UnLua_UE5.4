---Generates cluster convex hulls for leafs hulls
---@class FGenerateClusterConvexHullsFromLeafHullsDataflowNode : FDataflowNode
---@field public Collection FManagedArrayCollection
---@field public SphereCovering FDataflowSphereCovering @A representation of the negative space protected by the 'protect negative space' option. If negative space is not protected, this will contain zero spheres.
---@field public ConvexCount integer @Maximum number of convex to generate for a specific cluster. Will be ignored if error tolerance is used instead
---@field public ErrorTolerance number @Error tolerance to use to decide to merge leaf convex together. This is in centimeters and represents the side of a cube, the volume of which will be used as threshold to know if the volume of the generated convex is too large compared to the sum of the volume of the leaf convex
---@field public bPreferExternalCollisionShapes boolean @Whether to prefer available External (imported) collision shapes instead of the computed convex hulls on the Collection
---@field public AllowMerges EAllowConvexMergeMethod @Method to determine which convex hull pairs can potentially be merged
---@field public OptionalSelectionFilter FDataflowTransformSelection @Optional transform selection to compute cluster hulls on -- if not provided, all cluster hulls will be computed.
---@field public bProtectNegativeSpace boolean @Whether to use a sphere cover to define negative space that should not be covered by convex hulls
---@field public SampleMethod ENegativeSpaceSampleMethodDataflowEnum @Method to use to find and sample negative space
---@field public bRequireSearchSampleCoverage boolean @Whether to require that all candidate locations identified by Voxel Search are covered by negative space samples, up to the specified Min Sample Spacing. Only applies to Voxel Search.
---@field public bOnlyConnectedToHull boolean @When performing Voxel Search, only look for negative space that is connected out to the convex hull. This removes inaccessable internal negative space from consideration. Only applies to Voxel Search.
---@field public TargetNumSamples integer @Approximate number of spheres to consider when covering negative space
---@field public MinSampleSpacing number @Minimum desired spacing between spheres; if > 0, will attempt not to place sphere centers closer than this
---@field public NegativeSpaceTolerance number @Amount of space to leave between convex hulls and protected negative space
---@field public MinRadius number @Spheres smaller than this are not included in the negative space
