---* A mesh instance is a description of a translated scene node that points to a translated mesh asset.
---* A mesh instance that points to an LOD group can have many LODs and many scene mesh nodes per LOD index.
---* A mesh instance that points to a mesh node will have only LOD 0 and will point to one scene mesh node.
