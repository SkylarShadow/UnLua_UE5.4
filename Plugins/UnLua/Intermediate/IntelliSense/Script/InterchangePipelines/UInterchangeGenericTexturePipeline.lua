---@class UInterchangeGenericTexturePipeline : UInterchangePipelineBase
---@field public PipelineDisplayName string @The name of the pipeline that will be display in the import dialog.
---@field public bImportTextures boolean @If enabled, imports all texture assets found in the source.
---@field public AssetName string @If set, and there is only one asset and one source, the imported asset will be given this name.
---@field public bDetectNormalMapTexture boolean @If enabled, tests each newly imported texture to see if it is a normal map. If it is, the SRGB, Compression Settings, and LOD Group properties of that texture will be adjusted.
---@field public bFlipNormalMapGreenChannel boolean @If enabled, the texture's green channel will be inverted for normal maps. This setting is only used if the Detect Normal Map Texture setting is also enabled.
---@field public bImportUDIMs boolean @If enabled, imports textures as UDIMs if they are named using a UDIM naming pattern.
---@field public FileExtensionsToImportAsLongLatCubemap TSet<string> @Specify the file types that should be imported as long/lat cubemaps.
---@field public bPreferCompressedSourceData boolean @If enabled, the translator compresses the source data payload whenever possible. This generally results in smaller assets. However, some operations like the texture build might be slower, because the source data first needs to be decompressed. If disabled, the translator leaves the decision to the factory or the pipelines.
---@field public bAllowNonPowerOfTwo boolean @If enabled, textures that have a non-power-of-two resolution are imported.
---@field private BaseNodeContainer UInterchangeBaseNodeContainer
